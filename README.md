**Conclusion:**

The quarter-wave transformer was successfully designed and simulated using CST Studio Suite 2019 to match a 50 Ω microstrip line with a 123 Ω load. The simulation results verified efficient impedance matching, showing minimal reflection and improved power transfer at the designed frequency. Hence, the design effectively demonstrates the principle of impedance matching using a quarter-wave transformer.
